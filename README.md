# Solr

_Klassenlager 2022 project_

- [Can be seen live here](solr.vercel.app)

## Preface

We want to create both a visual dictionary as well as a 3D model of our solar system.

Along side the fun of dealing with our solar system, this project aims to be a playground especially for [GSAP](https://greensock.com) as well as [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and if we will have enough time and reach it also [Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/).
In the background of it thought, is the use of the Panter stack and implamantation of frontend concepts from my training program such as:

- coding techniques:
  - KISS, DRY, SOLID and Occamâ€™s Razor principles
  - Design patterns in frontend development
  - Functional Programming
  - Component Design
  - Code quality
  - Best practices
  - Project structure - file structure, naming conventions
- Practical:
  - TypeScript
  - React (Next.js)
  - State Management
  - Consuming a (graphql) API
  - Building functional components
  - Routing
  - Responsivity
- Tooling
  - GIT
  - formatters (prettier), linters (eslint), scaffolding (plop)
  - CI/CD basics (set up of the project pipelines)
- Soft skills
  - Solve mid complex problems independently
